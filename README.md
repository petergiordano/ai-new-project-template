# AI-Assisted Project Template

### **Purpose: A streamlined workflow for developing with AI assistance.**

This repository is a template for starting new software projects using a structured, AI-assisted workflow. It provides a simple command-driven process that guides you from project idea to implementation.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (2 minutes)

### **Step 1: Create Your Project Workspace**

**Use "Save As..." in VS Code:**
1. **File > Save Workspace As...** from this template
2. **Name your project** (e.g., `my-awesome-app`)
3. **Open your new workspace** in VS Code

### **Step 2: Start Building**

**Open terminal and run these commands:**

```bash
# Start Claude Code CLI
claude

# Set up your project workspace (one-time only)
/setup-project

# Begin feature development 
/start-coding
```

That's it! The commands will guide you through everything else.

## ðŸŽ¯ Complete User Journey

```
1. "Save As..." template â†’ your-project-workspace
2. /setup-project (one-time workspace setup)
3. Setup Chat AI Strategist (recommended)
4. /start-coding (foundation â†’ PRD â†’ tasks â†’ implementation)
5. /start-coding (next feature: PRD â†’ tasks â†’ implementation)
6. /orient (anytime navigation)
```

### **What Each Command Does:**

- **`/setup-project`** - One-time cleanup and workspace preparation
- **`/start-coding`** - Intelligent feature development orchestrator  
- **`/orient`** - Check current state and get guidance anytime

## ðŸ§  How It Works

### **3-Party Collaboration Model**
- **You:** Project director making decisions
- **Chat AI:** Strategic planning and context preparation
- **CLI AI:** Technical implementation and file operations

### **5-Step Workflow (Automated)**
1. **Project Foundation** - AI interview creates project context
2. **Dynamic Context** - Automatic context loading for AI assistants  
3. **Feature Planning** - PRD creation with validation criteria
4. **Task Generation** - Detailed implementation breakdown
5. **Quality Implementation** - Code execution with progressive validation

## ðŸ“‚ Template Structure

After `/setup-project`, your workspace will look like:

```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/                    # Claude Code configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ .ai-rules/                  # AI workflow instructions
â”œâ”€â”€ .project-docs/              # Project planning documents
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                        # Your application source code
â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/                      # Feature PRDs and task lists
â”œâ”€â”€ setup-claude-chat-ai/       # Chat AI Strategist setup instructions
â”œâ”€â”€ README-project.md           # Your project's README
â”œâ”€â”€ TODO.md                     # Development task tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ AI_CONTEXT.md              # AI assistant briefing
â””â”€â”€ WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md          # Complete workflow documentation
```
