# AI-Assisted Project Template (Manual Workflow)

### **Purpose: A step-by-step, human-guided workflow for developing with AI.**

This repository is a scaffolding template for starting new software projects using a structured, AI-assisted workflow. It is designed for a "human-in-the-loop" process where you guide an AI assistant through each step of development.

This template is ideal for:
- Smaller, well-defined features.
- Projects where you need precise control over every implementation detail.
- Learning a new codebase or framework with AI assistance.

## Template Structure

This scaffolding provides a set of rule files and document templates to guide your development process. The three key documents in the root directory are:

- **`README.md`**: (This file) A high-level overview of the template's purpose.
- **`WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`**: The primary user manual. **Start here for instructions.**
- **`AI_CONTEXT.md`**: The master briefing document to provide context to your AI assistant.
