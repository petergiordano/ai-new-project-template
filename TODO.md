# Session TODO: AI-Assisted Development Template Enhancement

## Tasks for This Session (REVISED ORDER)

## üéâ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Context Engineering Framework Complete!

### ‚úÖ ALL CONTEXT ENGINEERING ENHANCEMENTS IMPLEMENTED!
- **A. Command Structure Enhancement** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **B. Context Convergence Pattern** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- **C. Validation Loop Integration** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**üöÄ SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION ACHIEVED:**
- Template evolved from static to dynamic context engineering system
- AI assistants now have systematic validation loops and error correction
- Context accumulates across workflow stages (vs. static briefing)
- Command-driven transitions with human approval gates maintained
- 4-level progressive validation prevents error accumulation
- Context drift prevention and recovery mechanisms implemented

**üìù COMMITTED TO GITHUB:** All enhancements successfully committed and pushed

## REMAINING TASKS (Now Prioritized)

### üî• NEXT PRIORITY: Complete User Experience (Tasks 2-3)

### ‚úÖ 2. Add Workspace Setup Instructions - **COMPLETED**
**Goal:** Update docs to instruct users to "Save Workspace As..." with optimal context preservation
- [x] Update README.md with workspace setup steps
- [x] Update WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md with clear workspace instructions  
- [x] Add visual clarity about the template vs. project distinction
- [x] Apply context engineering principles for smooth onboarding
- [x] Prioritize "Save As" approach for personal use workflow

### ‚úÖ 3. Define Post-Setup Actions - **COMPLETED**
**Goal:** Make it crystal clear what users should do immediately after "Save As"
- [x] Create clear "Getting Started" section in main docs
- [x] Define the exact sequence of first actions with optimal context loading
- [x] Reference the enhanced 5-step workflow entry point
- [x] Apply context continuity patterns for seamless transition
- [x] Add Quick Decision Tree for different user scenarios
- [x] Create three distinct paths: New Project, Existing Project, Exploration

### ‚úÖ 4. Create Claude Project for "Chat Assistant - Strategist" - **COMPLETED**
**Goal:** Build a dedicated Claude project with optimal context architecture
- [x] Write comprehensive project instructions leveraging context engineering framework
- [x] Determine which template docs should be included as project knowledge
- [x] Apply context chunking and role boundary insights from analysis
- [x] Create symbiotic relationship design between Chat AI and CLI AI
- [x] Build strategic workflow patterns for PRD and task generation
- [x] Include context validation checkpoints and response templates
- [x] Create setup instructions and workflow reference documents
- [x] Rename to PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md for clarity
- [x] Implement GitHub repository integration for live project context
- [x] Build automated session bridging with proven transition patterns
- [x] Create enhanced context continuity across multiple chat sessions

### 5. üìù Evaluate CLI Assistant Role Documentation
**Goal:** Determine optimal CLI Assistant context delivery method
- [ ] Assess current CLI briefing approach (enhanced AI_CONTEXT.md)
- [ ] Apply context engineering principles to determine brief vs. comprehensive approach
- [ ] Create CLI_ASSISTANT_BRIEF.md if analysis indicates it's needed
- [ ] Ensure context handoff efficiency between roles

## Current Template Status
- ‚úÖ Core workflow (5 steps) complete
- ‚úÖ Plan Mode integration complete  
- ‚úÖ All AI rule files created
- ‚úÖ Project context templates ready
- üîÑ **Working on:** User onboarding and role clarity

## Session Deliverables
1. Updated README.md and WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md with workspace instructions
2. Clear post-setup action sequence
3. Complete Claude project for Chat Assistant role
4. CLI Assistant role documentation (if needed)
5. Context engineering enhancement recommendations

## Notes
- Keep user's preference for numbered next steps in mind
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing template structure
- Focus on reducing friction for new users
