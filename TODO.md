# Session TODO: AI-Assisted Development Template Enhancement

## Tasks for This Session (REVISED ORDER)

### 1. ðŸŽ¯ Context Engineering Framework Analysis (PRIORITY)
**Goal:** Establish foundational context management principles that will inform all other decisions
- [ ] Analyze context continuity challenges across template â†’ project transition
- [ ] Define optimal context loading sequences for AI sessions
- [ ] Identify context drift prevention mechanisms across 5-step workflow
- [ ] Design role boundary validation for 3-party collaboration
- [ ] Evaluate context handoff patterns between Chat AI and CLI AI
- [ ] Research context engineering best practices and frameworks
- [ ] Document context architecture recommendations

### 2. âœ… Add Workspace Setup Instructions (INFORMED BY #1)
**Goal:** Update docs to instruct users to "Save Workspace As..." with optimal context preservation
- [ ] Update README.md with workspace setup steps
- [ ] Update WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md with clear workspace instructions
- [ ] Add visual clarity about the template vs. project distinction
- [ ] **Apply context engineering principles from #1**

### 3. âœ… Define Post-Setup Actions (INFORMED BY #1)
**Goal:** Make it crystal clear what users should do immediately after "Save As"
- [ ] Create clear "Getting Started" section in main docs
- [ ] Define the exact sequence of first actions with optimal context loading
- [ ] Reference the 5-step workflow entry point
- [ ] **Apply context continuity patterns from #1**

### 4. âœ… Create Claude Project for "Chat Assistant - Strategist" (INFORMED BY #1)
**Goal:** Build a dedicated Claude project with optimal context architecture
- [ ] Write comprehensive project instructions for the Chat Assistant role
- [ ] Determine which template docs should be included as project knowledge
- [ ] **Apply context chunking and role boundary insights from #1**
- [ ] Test the project setup to ensure it works as intended

### 5. âœ… Evaluate CLI Assistant Role Documentation (INFORMED BY #1)
**Goal:** Determine optimal CLI Assistant context delivery method
- [ ] Assess current CLI briefing approach (AI_CONTEXT.md)
- [ ] **Apply context engineering principles to determine brief vs. comprehensive approach**
- [ ] Create CLI_ASSISTANT_BRIEF.md if analysis indicates it's needed
- [ ] Ensure context handoff efficiency between roles

## Current Template Status
- âœ… Core workflow (5 steps) complete
- âœ… Plan Mode integration complete  
- âœ… All AI rule files created
- âœ… Project context templates ready
- ðŸ”„ **Working on:** User onboarding and role clarity

## Session Deliverables
1. Updated README.md and WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md with workspace instructions
2. Clear post-setup action sequence
3. Complete Claude project for Chat Assistant role
4. CLI Assistant role documentation (if needed)
5. Context engineering enhancement recommendations

## Notes
- Keep user's preference for numbered next steps in mind
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing template structure
- Focus on reducing friction for new users
