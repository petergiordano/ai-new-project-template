# Session TODO: AI-Assisted Development Template Enhancement

## Tasks for This Session (REVISED ORDER)

### 1. ðŸŽ¯ Context Engineering Framework Analysis (PRIORITY) - âœ… COMPLETED
**Goal:** Establish foundational context management principles that will inform all other decisions
- [x] Research context engineering best practices and frameworks (analyzed coleam00/context-engineering-intro)
- [x] Evaluate context handoff patterns between Chat AI and CLI AI
- [x] Identify context drift prevention mechanisms across 5-step workflow

**ANALYSIS RESULTS:**
**Context Engineering vs. Our Approach:**
- Context Engineering: Command-driven automation (`/generate-prp`, `/execute-prp`) with AI autonomy
- Our Template: Human-guided collaboration with 5-step workflow and multi-AI approach

**RECOMMENDATION: Enhance our template with precise point improvements instead of separate template**

**3 HIGH-IMPACT CONTEXT ENGINEERING IMPROVEMENTS TO IMPLEMENT:**

**A. Command Structure Enhancement** - âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Add `/generate-prd` and `/generate-tasks` commands to `.ai-rules/` (inspired by context engineering)
- [x] Create cleaner transitions between our 5 steps
- [x] Maintain human approval gates but streamline execution
- [x] Add command-driven phase boundaries for clarity

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**
- Created `.ai-rules/05_generate-prd-command.md` with structured PRD generation
- Created `.ai-rules/06_generate-tasks-command.md` with enhanced task breakdown
- Enhanced `.ai-rules/03_execute-tasks.md` with validation loops and progressive gates
- Added clear command-driven transitions: `/generate-prd` â†’ `/generate-tasks` â†’ `/execute-tasks`
- Maintained human approval gates while streamlining execution flow

**B. Context Convergence Pattern** - âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Enhance AI_CONTEXT.md to accumulate context across workflow steps (vs. static document)
- [x] Add "context validation" checkpoints in workflow
- [x] Implement context handoff protocols between Chat AI and CLI AI
- [x] Create context continuity patterns for template â†’ project transition

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**
- Created dynamic AI_CONTEXT.md that accumulates context across workflow
- Added systematic context validation checkpoints at each workflow stage
- Implemented context handoff protocols between Chat AI and CLI AI
- Enhanced Step 2 of workflow with context convergence approach
- Added context drift prevention and recovery mechanisms

**C. Validation Loop Integration** - âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Add executable validation steps to task execution (like PRP validation loops)
- [x] Create "success criteria" checklists that AI can verify
- [x] Build error correction guidance into execute-tasks rule
- [x] Implement progressive validation (syntax â†’ tests â†’ integration)

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**
- Created comprehensive validation framework with 4-level progressive validation
- Added executable validation steps to all task generation and execution
- Enhanced PRD creation with specific success criteria and validation commands
- Implemented systematic error correction protocols for AI self-correction
- Added validation status tracking and context accumulation
- Integrated validation loops into all command structures

**ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS:**
- Context continuity challenges: Template uses multiple specialized docs vs. single comprehensive PRP
- Role boundary validation: Need clearer handoff protocols between Chat AI (strategist) and CLI AI (implementer)
- Context loading sequences: Should accumulate context progressively vs. loading all at once

### 2. âœ… Add Workspace Setup Instructions (INFORMED BY #1)
**Goal:** Update docs to instruct users to "Save Workspace As..." with optimal context preservation
- [ ] Update README.md with workspace setup steps
- [ ] Update WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md with clear workspace instructions
- [ ] Add visual clarity about the template vs. project distinction
- [ ] **Apply context engineering principles from #1**

### 3. âœ… Define Post-Setup Actions (INFORMED BY #1)
**Goal:** Make it crystal clear what users should do immediately after "Save As"
- [ ] Create clear "Getting Started" section in main docs
- [ ] Define the exact sequence of first actions with optimal context loading
- [ ] Reference the 5-step workflow entry point
- [ ] **Apply context continuity patterns from #1**

### 4. âœ… Create Claude Project for "Chat Assistant - Strategist" (INFORMED BY #1)
**Goal:** Build a dedicated Claude project with optimal context architecture
- [ ] Write comprehensive project instructions for the Chat Assistant role
- [ ] Determine which template docs should be included as project knowledge
- [ ] **Apply context chunking and role boundary insights from #1**
- [ ] Test the project setup to ensure it works as intended

### 5. âœ… Evaluate CLI Assistant Role Documentation (INFORMED BY #1)
**Goal:** Determine optimal CLI Assistant context delivery method
- [ ] Assess current CLI briefing approach (AI_CONTEXT.md)
- [ ] **Apply context engineering principles to determine brief vs. comprehensive approach**
- [ ] Create CLI_ASSISTANT_BRIEF.md if analysis indicates it's needed
- [ ] Ensure context handoff efficiency between roles

## Current Template Status
- âœ… Core workflow (5 steps) complete
- âœ… Plan Mode integration complete  
- âœ… All AI rule files created
- âœ… Project context templates ready
- ðŸ”„ **Working on:** User onboarding and role clarity

## Session Deliverables
1. Updated README.md and WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md with workspace instructions
2. Clear post-setup action sequence
3. Complete Claude project for Chat Assistant role
4. CLI Assistant role documentation (if needed)
5. Context engineering enhancement recommendations

## Notes
- Keep user's preference for numbered next steps in mind
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing template structure
- Focus on reducing friction for new users
