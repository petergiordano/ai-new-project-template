# Claude Project Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This guide helps you create a dedicated Claude Project companion for your development work, providing persistent project knowledge and enhanced AI assistance throughout the development lifecycle.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### 1. Create Your Claude Project
1. Go to [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Click "Create Project" 
3. Name it: `[YourProjectName] Development`
4. Add project description

### 2. Configure Project Instructions
1. Copy `TEMPLATE_claude-project-instructions.md`
2. Fill in all `[bracketed sections]` with your project details
3. Paste into your Claude Project's instructions field

### 3. Add Knowledge Base Documents
Add these files to your Claude Project's knowledge base:
- `AI_CONTEXT.md` - Your dynamic project context
- `WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` - Development workflow reference
- Key PRDs from `tasks/` folder
- Any project-specific reference documents

### 4. Set Up Quick Status Reference
The template includes a "Quick Project Status Reference" section that helps you:
- Quickly orient yourself at the start of each session
- Find current work status without searching
- Identify next steps immediately
- Access detailed task information

## ðŸ“‹ Template Customization Guide

### Project Identity & Mission
- Replace `[PROJECT NAME]` with your actual project name
- Write a clear, one-sentence mission statement
- Keep the core mission focused and actionable

### Technical Stack & Components

- Include version numbers for languages and frameworks
- Focus on core dependencies, not every library

### Development Philosophy
- State your actual development principles
- Make them specific to your project's needs
- Keep them actionable and measurable

### Success Metrics & Validation
- Define what "done" looks like for your project

## ðŸ”„ Maintenance & Updates

### When to Update Project Instructions
- After completing major features
- When architectural decisions change
- When new constraints or requirements emerge
- When switching development focus areas

### What to Update
1. **Quick Project Status Reference** - Keep examples current
2. **Active Features** - Reflect current development state
3. **Success Metrics** - Adjust based on learnings
4. **Essential Documents** - Add new critical references

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of Claude Project Integration
