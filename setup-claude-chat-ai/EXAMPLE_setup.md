## 3. Create Claude Project

1. Go to Claude.ai
2. Create Project named "TaskFlow Pro Development"
3. Paste your customized instructions
4. Upload these files to knowledge base:
   - `AI_CONTEXT.md`
   - `WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`
   - Any completed PRDs

## 4. Use Quick Status Checks

```
You: "What's my current status?"

Claude: "Checking TaskFlow Pro status...
- TODO.md: User authentication system in progress
- AI_CONTEXT.md: Auth PRD created, tasks generated
- Next: Implement JWT token generation (task 2.1)
- See: tasks/tasks-prd-user-auth.md for details"
```

## 5. Benefit from Persistent Knowledge

- Your tech stack and conventions
- Completed features and patterns
- Current development focus
- Architectural decisions

Your Chat AI Strategist now has permanent project awareness!
