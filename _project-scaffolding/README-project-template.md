# [Project Name]

**[Brief one-sentence description of what your project does]**

## ðŸš€ Development Workflow

This project uses the AI-Assisted Development Framework for efficient feature development.

### **Quick Start Commands**

```bash
# Check current project state and get guidance
/orient

# Develop new features (foundation â†’ PRD â†’ tasks â†’ implementation)
/start-coding

# Set up workspace (already completed during project setup)
# /setup-project
```

### **Development Journey**
```
1. âœ… Project setup complete (/setup-project)
2. ðŸ”„ Feature development (/start-coding)
3. ðŸ”„ Next feature (/start-coding)
4. ðŸ§­ Navigation (/orient anytime)
```

**Your foundation documents are in `.project-docs/`:**
- `Roadmap.md` - Project vision and goals
- `VibeTesting.md` - User experience design
- `ComponentLibrary.md` - Design system
- `SLC_Session_Notes.md` - Development planning

## Development

### **AI-Assisted Development**

This project uses a structured AI collaboration workflow:

- **Chat AI (Strategy):** Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini for planning and context
- **CLI AI (Implementation):** Claude Code/Gemini CLI for technical execution
- **Progressive Validation:** 4-level quality gates ensure reliable code

### **Adding New Features**

```bash
# Start feature development workflow
/start-coding

# The system will guide you through:
# 1. Feature definition (PRD creation)
# 2. Task breakdown (implementation planning)
# 3. Code execution (with validation)
```

### **Project State Management**

```bash
# Check where you are and what's next
/orient

# Examples of what you might see:
# "Foundation complete â†’ Ready for first feature"
# "PRD exists â†’ Generate task list"
# "Tasks ready â†’ Begin implementation"
```

### Running Tests

```bash
[test commands]
```

### Building

```bash
[build commands]
```

## AI Development Context

Your project's AI context is maintained in `AI_CONTEXT.md` and includes:
- Project goals and technical approach
- Coding conventions and architecture patterns
- Dependencies and constraints
- Testing requirements

This context automatically loads when using Claude Code or Gemini CLI.

## Contributing

[How others can contribute to your project]

### For Contributors Using AI Assistance

1. **Read the project context:** Check `AI_CONTEXT.md` and `.project-docs/`
2. **Use the workflow:** Follow the `/start-coding` process for new features
3. **Maintain quality:** Leverage the built-in validation systems
